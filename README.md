<h2>Using Github</h2>
<h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
<p>Imagine GitHub as a digital workspace where you and others can collaborate on building things together. Think of it like a shared online notebook for writing code.</p>
<h3>What can you do with GitHub?</h3>
<p>On GitHub you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Store your code: Keep your code organized and safe in the cloud.</li>
  <li>Track changes: See who made what changes to your code and when.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with others: Work on coding projects with other people.</li>
  <li>Learn from others: Explore and learn from code written by others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Repository: This is like a folder where you store your code files.</li>
  <li>Commit: This is a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time.</li>
  <li>Branch: This is a copy of your code where you can make changes without affecting the original.</li>
  <li>Pull request: This is a way to suggest changes to someone else's code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of it like writing a book:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The repository is the book itself.</li>
  <li>Each chapter is a branch.</li>
  <li>Saving your progress is a commit.</li>
  <li>Asking a friend to review your chapter is a pull request.</li>
</ul>
